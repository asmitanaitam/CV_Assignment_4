This repository contains code and video/image files for Computer Vision assignment 4.

# DepthAI SLAM Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) project using the DepthAI framework and OAK-D cameras. The implementation captures stereo images and processes them to detect features, track objects, and estimate their 3D positions, building a map of the environment in real-time.

## SLAM Output Snapshots

The following snapshots illustrate the output of the SLAM process, showing the feature points detected and the reconstructed 3D environment.

### Indoor Environment

This image displays the 3D point cloud generated by the SLAM system, representing the spatial distribution of feature points.

### SLAM Visualization

Here we have the real-time visualization of the SLAM process with feature points overlaid on the actual environment captured by the stereo camera setup.

## Limitations and Observations

- Sparse points and uneven feature distribution which can affect the mapping robustness.
- Presence of outliers indicating potential incorrect feature matching or noise.
- SVD not converging, suggesting issues with input data quality or insufficient correspondences.


## Getting Started

To run this project, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asmitanaitam/CV_Assignment_4/blob/main/Q_2_depthai-slam
cd depthai-slam
# Follow installation and setup instructions
